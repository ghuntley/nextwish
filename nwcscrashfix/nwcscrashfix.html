        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Recently their has been alot of cheats released for counter-strike. One of those cheats is actually a Denial of Service attack, which when a cheater uses it on the server that you are playing on it either makes your half-life crash, requiring you to restart your computer or it kicks you from the server complaining about hostage skins being incorrect. Unfortunatly, 2 Versions of Counter-Strike have past and the exploit has yet to be fixed, so this is where NextWish's Counter-Strike Crash fix comes into play. The files contained on this page are client side patches, which prevent people from using the exploit on you. Also in this version, is a client side fix, which detects people from going invisibile -  below is a screenshot of the invisibility of the cheat detection. The guy above the glock is using the skin cheat, thus if you see someone that looks similar they are trying to use the invisibility cheat. </FONT>

        Above is a screenshot of the invisibility cheat detection in the latest version. The guy above the glock is using the skin cheat, thus if you see someone that looks similar they are using that cheat. Also in this screenshot is the Helicopter, you will notice that it is now rainbow and looks like the skin of the invis cheaters - Unfortunatly this is required for it to work :(

            <h2>Please Note:</h2>
            <LI>This version of the crash fix works by replacing your hostage models, so by installing this any custom hostages you have installed will be overwritten, and also if you install any other custom hostages the fix will no longer work!</LI>
            <LI>This version also detects the invisibility cheat, if you see a player that looks all rainbowish, then that person is using the invisibility cheat.</LI>
            <LI>If you choose to use this patch, you are using it of your own free will. Neither the official Counter-Strike team, Valve or Sierra can give you support for this patch. For all support questions consirning this patch, contact me (NextWish).</LI>
            <LI>This is a <b>client</b> side patch, server admins installing this on your server will unfortunatly accomplish nothing. However, you can allways put a link to this page in your MOTD to let your users know that their is a DoS attack out their in the wild thats being used, and their is a temp patch avail. =p</LI>
            <li>Their is a side effect with using this patch, your helicopter on AS_ Maps will turn rainbow and have a really bad texture - It's required to detect the cheaters.</li>
