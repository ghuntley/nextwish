About this modification:
Scripts in Front Line Forces if used and set-up correctly can give you that vital edge over your opponents. This is where NextWish's Front Line Force script comes in. All your settings are easily customisable and contrary to many other scripts out there, this script can be easily configured from Front Line Forces's Keyboard Configuration menu. This eliminates the need for nasty console binding and notepad editing!

Features:
1) Everything is configurable using the ingame Front Line Force controls menu! ( This script was the first to offer this!) 
2) Using radio simplied down to just pressing one button per radio command 
3) A Select best weapon function, when activiated will select the best weap you currently have and place the others in lastinv. 
4) A Quick Knife Slash, which pulls out your knife and starts slashing whilst you hold down the button assigned to it but when you let go it will stop slashing then go back to your previous weapon. (Great for those upclose fights!) 
5) A Grenade Toggler and Thrower which pulls out the grenade you have toggled and warns your team which type of grenade you are throwing then pulls it's pin and throws it and starts timer which will count down how many seconds until the grenade blows up. 
6) A Floating in Water Toggler which when turned on it will make you float in the water. (Good for when you want to say something buy your swimming in water and dont want to drown - Just activate it and type away your message and you wont drown. Press the key assigned to it to turn it back off. 
7) A Walking/Running toggler when the key assigned to it is pressed it will either make you run or walk. 
8) A Crouching Toggler which when the key assigned to it is pressed it will either make you crouch or not crouch. 
9) Tested for days to see if it's solid, and it is! 
10) Fully modular, other scripts can be used with it, simply by creating a file called autoexec.cfg and placing the other scripts in that file. 
11) Easy for advanced and beginers to modify the script in any way they like. (The Script is Fully Commented)
