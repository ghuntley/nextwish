Version 11, of my <a href="/mods/misc/cstrike-mapfix.shtml">Counter-Strike Map fix</a> is now available for download. This modification is for those people who rushed out to buy Counter-Strike Retail only to find that half of the maps are missing, it installs all of the textures and maps that are missing from Counter-Strike Retail.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
In other news all download mirrors have been disabled until the net recovers from the release of the CS and HL patches. ( The files are still available to download, but only from this website )
